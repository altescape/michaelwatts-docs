### Summary:
Are You Fashion? was a successful campaign in Saudi to build awareness of the new Saudi Fashion Magazine brand.

The campaign included printed collateral such as bill-board posters on the side of malls in Saudi and marketing on Facebook and Twitter. 

People would enter their details, leave a message about why they 'were fashion' and upload a picture of themselves. A gallery in the style of Pinterest with a voting mechanic also featured after enough entries had been submitted.

### Breakdown of work:
